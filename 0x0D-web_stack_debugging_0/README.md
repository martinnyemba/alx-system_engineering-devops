# 0x0D. Web stack debugging #0

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- Network basics
- Docker
- Web stack debugging
## Backgroung
Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that 
once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going 
on and fix it manually.

## Requirements:

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All your Bash script files must be executable
Your Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error
Your Bash scripts must run without error
The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing


## Task :page_with_curl:

* **0. Give me a page!**
  * [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): Bash script that runs Apache on a
  web server and gets it to respond to queries to the root.
