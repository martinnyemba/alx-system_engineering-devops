# Project : 0x0C. Web server

 exercise is aiming at training you on automating your work. If you can automate tasks that you do manually, you 
can then automate yourself out of repetitive tasks and focus your energy on something more interesting. For an SRE, 
that comes very handy when there are hundreds or thousands of servers to manage, the work cannot be only done manually. 
Note that the checker will execute your script as the root user, you do not need to use the sudo command.

A good Software Engineer is a lazy Software Engineer.

General objectives:

* What is the main role of a web server
* What is a child process
* Why web servers usually have a parent process and child processes
* What are the main HTTP requests
DNS
* What DNS stands for
* What is DNS main role

The server is accessible at [bdbnb.site](http://bdbnb.site).

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Transfer a file to your server**
  * [0-transfer_file](./0-transfer_file): Bash script that transfers a file
  from Holberton's client to a server.
  * Accepts four arguments:
    * The path of the file to be transferred.
    * The IP of the server to transfer the file to.
    * The username that `scp` connects with.
    * The path of the SSH privtae key that `scp` uses.
  * `scp` transfers the file to the user home directory `~/`.

* **1. Install nginx web server**
  * [1-install_nginx_web_server](./1-install_nginx_web_server): Bash script
  that configures a new Ubuntu machine with Nginx.
  * Nginx listens on port 80.
  * When querying Nginx at its root `/` with a `curl` GET request,
  it returns a page containing the string `Hello World`.

* **2. Setup a domain name**
  * [2-setup_a_domain_name](./2-setup_a_domain_name): A text file containing
  the domain name set up for the server through Gandi.

* **3. Redirection**
  * [3-redirection](./3-redirection): Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu
  machine with Nginx.
  * Setup is identical to [1-install_nginx_web_server](./1-install_nginx_web_server)
  plus:
    * The location `/redirect_me` returns a `301 Moved Permanently` redirection
    to another page.

* **4. Not found page 404**
  * [4-not_found_page_404](./4-not_found_page_404): Bash script that configures
  a new Ubuntu machine with Nginx.
  * Setup is identical to [1-install_nginx_web_server](./1-install_nginx_web_server)
  plus:
    * Features a custom 404 page containing the string `Ceci n'est pas une page`.

* **5. Design a beautiful 404 page**
  * A custom-designed 404 error page for my server, accessible at
  [bdbnb.site/404](http://bdbnb.site/404).

* **6. Deploy fast, deploy well**
  * [fabfile.py](./fabfile.py): A Python Fabric configuration file defining
  the following functions:
  * `pack`
    * Usage: `fabric pack`
    * Creates a tar gzipped archive of the current directory named
    `holbertonwebapp.tar.gz` in the local directory.
  * `deploy`
    * Usage: `fabric -H <remote server IP> deploy`
    * Uploads the archive `holbertonwebapp.tar.gz` to the `/tmp`
    directory of the remote server.
    * Creates the directory `/tmp/holbertonwebapp` in the remote server.
    * Untars `holbertonwebapp.tar.gz` in the `/tmp/holbertonwebapp` directory
    of the remote server.
  * `clean`
    * Deletes the archive `holbertonwebapp.tar.gz` in the local directory.
