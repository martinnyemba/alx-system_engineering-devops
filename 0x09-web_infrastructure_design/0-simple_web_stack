server - A computer devices that is able to provide services and resources to other devices over a network.

Role of the domain name - This is the human readable address of our website in this case being "www.foobar.com". 
                          It makes it easier for users to find a website than using the IP address.



What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com

"www" in www.foobar.com is a canonical Name record, it points to the server "foobar.com" to ensure that user can reach the intended website.


role of the web server - Handling HTTP User request. 
                 It acts as a mediator between incoming traffic from the user and process and foward the requests to the application server ensuring that the user receives web content requested.

role of the application server - Handles excecution of the server side code and communicates to the database to retreive or store information.

role of the database - Helps to organize the collection of structured data stored by the user.

What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website  -- internet



SPOF - Because our infrastructure relies on a single server it is vulnerable to down time due to hardware or network failure or other problems.

During maintenance the website may be unavailable, as it requires to restart the web server.


why can't we scale the infrastrucute
- There is no load balancing so when there is too much traffic our server is unable to accomodate high traffic hence limited scalability.
